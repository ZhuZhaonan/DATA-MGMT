# Does organizational capacity could influence foundation's donation income?

## 1. Research question
This research studies factors that could influence foundation's income donation. According to leterature review, previous studies found that there are many factors have relationship with nonprofit organazations' donation income, such as
 1. government funding
 2. government relationship
 3. organizational characteristic: 
 > size
 > age
 > type


A set of variables measuring organizational capacity includes age, asset size, and board size. According to organizational ecology theory, new and/or small organizations are more likely to be in uenced by the external environment, these phenomena are termed the \liability of newness" and \liability of smallness" respectively (Baum and Shipilov 2006, 62-63). This perspective sets the rationale for controlling age and asset size. Organizations with larger boards of trustees may be stronger in organizational capacity and have more social connections with donors. These control variables were also used in numerous previous studies (e.g., Ni et al. 2016; Ni and Zhan 2017; Nie, Liu, and Cheng 2016; Wei 2017).




Variables measuring government connections. As previously mentioned, the GONGOs are more likely to receive government funding because of their close connections with the government. In this study, a foundation is identied as GONGO if it meets one of the
following criteria (Ni and Zhan 2017, 735; Q. Wang 2018):
> 1. The founding organization is governmental or quasi-governmental;
> 2. The initial endowment is from a governmental agency;
> 3. The current or retired government ocials are employees or board members;
> 4. They share the same oce address with supervising or sponsoring governmental or quasi-governmental organizations.

Other than the dummy variable measuring being GONGO or not, variables counting the number of government ocials on board are also used as controls including \number of government ocials serving as principals" and \number of retired government ocials who are provincial or above."


government funding, management expense ratio, size, age of organization, location,subsector(service area).

However, in China, empirical studies on this topic are limit, and researches have fallen short of analysing evaluation result as a influence factor.

Ideally, organization's evaluation result is a kind of important information for public and donors to make their donation decision. Evaluation result should help the nonprofit sector develop the mechanism of selecting the superior organizaitons and eliminating the inferior ones.
