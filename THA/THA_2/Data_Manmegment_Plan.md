# Data Management and Research Life Cycle

## Overview
This repository created for the coure Data Management and Research Life Cycle (2019-spring)in University Texas at Austin. It includes all files about my assignments and final project. 

## Final Project Research idea
I want to study the relationship between foundations' evaluation result and their donation income. Ideally, organization's evaluation result is a kind of important information for public and donors to make their donation decision. Evaluation result should help the nonprofit sector develop the mechanism of selecting the superior organizaitons and eliminating the inferior ones. However, empirical studies on this topic are limit, and researches has fallen short of analysing what factors could contribute to the relationship. My research questions are as follow:
* Whether the evaluation result could influence foundation's donation income? 
* How the evaluation result influence foundation's donation income? 

Variables 
* dependent variables: donation income
* independent variables(guess): evaluation result,  transparency of evaluation result, others.
* control variables(guess): Areas of Foucus,Founding date, type of foundation(private foundation, public foundation, community foundation),Number of Full-time employees, Initial Fund, others. 

## Data management plan

### Databese
I will use RICF dataset to do the research.

### File organization
My files will be organized in the following folders:
* “Assignments”: four assigenemts files.
*  “Final”: final project and versions of all supporting files.
*  “Draft”: all copies of my assignements and final project draft files.

### File naming
* Assigenments files will be named with the following convention: “YYYYMMDD_Assigenment_x_vx.docx” (e.g. “20190301_Assigenment_1_v2.docx”). 
* All other files will be descriptively and concisely named.

### Versioning
I will periodically save major files as new version numbers, as outlined by my naming convention. I will work to keep versions up to date between my storage and backups.

### Reference manager
I will use Zotero to organize my references and aid with citations. I will periodically export my references in the .CSV format to be stored in the “Drafts” folder. The exported files will be named using the following convention: “YYYYMMDD_Library.CSV”. I will regularly back up these files in conjunction with my other documents and a copy of my current library will be cloud hosted on the Zotero servers.

### Long-term preservation
At the completion of the project, I will convert my files into more open or common
