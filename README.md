# Data Management and Research Life Cycle

## Overview
This repository created for the coure Data Management and Research Life Cycle (2019-spring)in University Texas at Austin. It includes all files about my assignments and final project. 

## Data management plan

### Databese
I will use RICF dataset to do the research.

### File organization
My files will be organized in the following folders:
* “THA”: four assigenemts files.
*  “Final”: final project and versions of all supporting files.

### File naming
* Assigenments files will be named with the following convention: “YYYYMMDD_THA_x_vx.docx” (e.g. “20190301_Assigenment_1_v2.docx”). 
* All other files will be descriptively and concisely named.

### Versioning
I will periodically save major files as new version numbers, as outlined by my naming convention. I will work to keep versions up to date between my storage and backups.

### Reference manager
I will use Zotero to organize my references and aid with citations. I will periodically export my references in the .CSV format to be stored in the “Drafts” folder. The exported files will be named using the following convention: “YYYYMMDD_Library.CSV”. I will regularly back up these files in conjunction with my other documents and a copy of my current library will be cloud hosted on the Zotero servers.

### Long-term preservation
At the completion of the project, I will convert my files into more open or common
