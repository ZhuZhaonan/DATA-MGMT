# Research Proposal
## Research Questions
I want to study the relationship between foundations' evaluation result and their donation income. Ideally, organization's evaluation result is a kind of important information for public and donors to make their donation decision. Evaluation result should help the nonprofit sector develop the mechanism of selecting the superior organizations and eliminating the inferior ones. However, empirical studies on this topic are limit, and researches has fallen short of analyzing what factors could contribute to the relationship. My research questions are as follow:
* Whether the evaluation result could influence foundation's donation income?
* How the evaluation result influence foundation's donation income?
## Research Design
* dependent variable: donation income
* independent variables: evaluation result, transparency of evaluation result, others.
* control variables: areas of focus, Founding date, type of foundation (private foundation, public foundation, community foundation), number of full-time employees, initial fund, others.
## Analyze method: Multiple Regression Analysis

## Data Source
RICF is the research infrastructure of Chinese foundations, a database for Chinese civil society studies. The data are crawled, parsed, and compiled manually or automatically by computer programs from the following six sources, which are ranked by their credibility:
* Annual reports and audited financial reports.
* Information disclosed by supervising government departments.
* Information disclosed by the China Foundation Database (http://chinafoundation.org.cn; an information-disclosing platform supervised by the Civil Organization Administration Bureau, closed in early 2016 for unknown reasons).
* Information disclosed by the China Foundation Center (http://foundationcenter.org.cn; an information-disclosing platform run by a nonprofit organization).
* News from the foundation’s official website. The website snapshots are taken and stored under the “raw data” folder (see Data Records section below; the same for source #6).
* News from credible magazines or websites
The source, codebook and data format of this database.
* Source link: https://github.com/ma-ji/RICF/blob/master/2015/fa_2015.csv
* Codebooks: https://github.com/ma-ji/RICF/blob/master/RICF%20Codebook.xlsx
## Validation Methods
* Dataset validation method: I will compare test the dataset’s validation by compare the sample of RICF with China Foundation Database sample, select 5 variables to compare. 
* Results validation method: I will use robustness test to validate my analysis result. I intend to instead of donation income as total income to test the same equation.
